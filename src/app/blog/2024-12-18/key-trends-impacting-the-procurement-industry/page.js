                    <p className="text-sm md:text-md leading-normal md:leading-relaxed">Assessing the financial stability of your suppliers is a critical component of risk management in procurement. You need to ensure that they have the robustness to withstand market fluctuations and honour contractual obligations. This involves scrutinising their financial statements, credit ratings, and cash flow forecasts to gauge their long-term viability and protect your supply chain from potential disruptions.</p>
                    <p className="text-sm md:text-md leading-normal md:leading-relaxed">Engaging in due diligence, you should consider the supplier&#39;s track record of financial performance.
